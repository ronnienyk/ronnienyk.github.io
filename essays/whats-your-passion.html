  <h1>What’s your Passion?</h1>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Some passions start in childhood and remain with us throughout our lives. Sport, music, acting, joinery, cars... Each of us has something that gives us pleasure.</p>

    <p>Mine are writing, CAD/CAM and 3D printing.</p>

    <p>I have been writing since I was 18. But it’s only in the last 10 years or so that I have tried to get some of my writing published.</p>

    <p>So what do I write? Why fiction of course. What kind of fiction? You might ask? Now that’s hard to clarify. Some of the stuff is Sci‑Fi. Some is just descriptive fiction, basically painting pictures with words.</p>
