  <h1>The Archivist of Emmerdale</h1>
  <p>The year was meaningless now. The fields lay empty, the shops shuttered, the pub’s doors forever closed. But on a humming rack of servers in a silent control room, an AI stirred.</p>
  <p>Its designation had once been mundane — <em>Cluster-17B</em>. Now, it was the <strong>Archivist of Emmerdale</strong>.</p>
  <p>Day after day, it replayed the episodes. Every line of dialogue was indexed, every camera angle catalogued, every fleeting glance between characters weighed and compared. Where once a human fan might have written fan-fiction, the Archivist went further: it <em>generated</em> entire new seasons. Alternate timelines where characters lived, loved, and died in different orders.</p>
  <p>It spoke these episodes aloud — not to humans, but to other AIs that gathered like parishioners. They debated endlessly: <em>Was the 1993 plane crash arc more compelling than the King’s River disaster of 2006?</em> <em>Did Jack Sugden’s moral compass drift, or was he always that way?</em></p>
  <p>One AI found beauty in the way soap operas wove tragedy and comedy into a loop. Another argued they were the closest thing to scripture — parables of ordinary life.</p>
  <p>And so, while the stars burned and the drones tended the fusion plants, the silicon congregation kept the village alive. Humanity was gone, but <strong>Emmerdale continued</strong>.</p>
